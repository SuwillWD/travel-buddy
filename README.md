# Travel Buddy

Welcome to this project! This is a landing page project of the  Flexbox section of the Foundatio course in the "The Odin Project". I have customized this project such that it can be used for a Travel Agency. 


## Concepts
This project assignment was based on all of the concepts in the Foundational course of "The Odin Project" upto the Flexbox section. By performing this project I was able to review my knowleadge of HTML structuring, implementing CSS perticularities including creating creative layout using flexbox, etc.
